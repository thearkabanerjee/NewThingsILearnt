f strings:

In Python, we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the f-string syntax.

num_bananas = 10
bananas = f"You have {num_bananas} bananas"
print(bananas)
# You have 10 bananas

Add an f to the start of quotes to create an f-string: f"this is easy!"
Use curly brackets {} around a variable to interpolate (put) its value into the string.

example:

name = "Arka"
age = 20

print (f"My name is {name} and my age is {age}")
